/**
   Prints "Hello World".
   The purpose of this question is to check that you have started
   the wizard in the proper directory and in the proper way.
   The proper way is not by opening it in a browser, but by typing:
   java -jar wizard.jar
   The proper directory depends on whether you are using an IDE like
   bluej or eclipse.  If so, then create the project directory using 
   the IDE first, then put the jar file in the project directory and 
   start the jar file there.  That way the jar file will write files
   to the same directory, the project directory, where your IDE can 
   pick them up.  In the case of bluej, the simplest way to get the IDE
   to pick up the files (display them in the IDE) is to kill bluej
   each time the wizard writes files, and reopen bluej.  The files will
   then automatically appear.
