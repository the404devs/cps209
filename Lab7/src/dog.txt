dog
The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris[3] and Canis lupus
dingo[1][2]) is a domesticated form of the gray wolf, a member of the
Canidae family of the order Carnivora. The term is used for both feral
and pet varieties. The dog may have been the first animal to be
domesticated, and has been the most widely kept working, hunting, and
companion animal in human history. The word "dog" may also mean the
male of a canine species,[4] as opposed to the word "bitch" for the
female of the species.[5]
